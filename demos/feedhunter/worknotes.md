Bluesky came out with their first release of RSS feeds for each user's timeline, but their feed discovery link is a relative URL and we were not set up to handle it. In this release we make it work with relative URLs. 

This is what one of their link elements looks like:

`<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/rss">`
