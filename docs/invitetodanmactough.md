# Invite to Dan

The first invite for this repo went to Dan MacTough who wrote the node-feedparser package that the reallysimple package builds on. 

### The email

April 7, 2022

Dan I've been working on a new Node package, meant to be the absolutely final top-level API for reading feeds in a Node.js app. (And to serve as reference code for other platforms.)

It takes all the history, in theory, and wraps it up into a very concise, thoughtfully designed JavaScript object that makes no compromises to history. It probably won't reflect every feed out there, or least not yet, but that's the idea. Make the job of using RSS as simple as it should be.

Considering that the first version of RSS came out in 1999, which is 23 years ago, and there hasn't been any activity in the community to try to fix these problems since you came out with feedparser, who can object if I try to simplify this making it possible to build on this foundation, because now seems the time to do that.

I also have a new feed reader built on top of this, that's not yet ready for testing. It's a new design, handles titled and untitled posts, HTML styling, links, enclosures, unlimited length posts, and pretty much is what the Bluesky people should be trying to make but are nowhere near figuring that out yet, imho.

Anyway, I have invited you to review the project, because it contains your work, it builds on your feedparser package, with full and prominent credit and appreciation. I think it's time to clean all this up and get going. 

I've invited you to be a collaborator on the private repo. You're the first.
