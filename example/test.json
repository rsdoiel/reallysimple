            "description": "<p>I remember Watergate and the Gerald Ford pardon of Richard Nixon. Because right now that's the prior art. That's the event we're paying for now, and it seems as if we're about to repeat the mistake Ford made. While all the attention is focused on Putin and Ukraine. </p>\n<p>I remember Watergate. And I remember the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon\">pardon</a>, and remember that some people were very angry about it but I wasn't -- I was relieved. Finally we could stop obsessing over Nixon. He was obviously guilty right from the outset. Yet it took what seemed an incredibly long time to get from the initial reports of the break-in to his waving goodbye from the White House lawn as he left for the last time. That was the way I wanted to remember Nixon. Humiliated, brought down, going <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0\">off to exile</a> to spend the rest of his days wondering what if he hadn't cheated. Because the <a href=\"https://wapo.st/3iF4Rpe\">heart</a> of Watergate is the same issue as the heart of Trump, only what Trump did was a million times worse. We excused Nixon. I guess Trump, who is also old enough to remember it (he's ten years older than me) wasn't too concerned about paying a price if his attempted coup didn't work. Now they're getting ready to do it again, they're doing it in the open, and it looks like a perfect plan. If it works, we've already had the last real national election in the US. From now-on they will all be Putinesqe parodies of fair elections. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0\">Nixon's farewell</a>, 1974.</p>\n<p>So here we are.</p>\n<p>Can you imagine how the rest of the world sees the January 6 attack on the US Capitol?</p>\n<p>Spoiler: It scares the shit out of them. Because the main product the US sells is safety. Our financial system is where the world stores their money for safe keeping.</p>\n<p>What scares them even more? We haven't done anything about it. Trump and all the people who organized the coup are free. No prospect of any punishment. The can do it again and again.</p>\n<p>If you're smart you're looking for the next safe place to put your savings.</p>\n<p>I want to know this -- why isn't journalism running constant articles, reports and panels on this topic:</p>\n<p>When will Trump be charged?</p>\n<p>We failed to learn the lesson from Nixon it seems. </p>\n<p>Maybe one of the networks should give time to Dan Rather to look at the story from that angle. Every night at an assigned time. Rather reported Watergate. No doubt he remember.</p>\n<p>PS: One thing that seems evident after the Putin attack on Ukraine. The only people outside the US who want the Repubs to win are other despots whose people would <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu#Death\">kill</a> them if they could. </p>",

And I remember the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon\">pardon</a>, and remember that some people were very angry about it but I wasn't -- I was relieved. Finally we could stop obsessing over Nixon. He was obviously guilty right from the outset. Yet it took what seemed an incredibly long time to get from the initial reports of the break-in to his waving goodbye from the White House lawn as he left for the last time. That was the way I wanted to remember Nixon. Humiliated, brought down, going <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0\">off to exile</a> to spend the rest of his days wondering what if he hadn't cheated. Because the <a href=\"https://wapo.st/3iF4Rpe\">heart</a> of Watergate is the same issue as the heart of Trump, only what Trump did was a million times worse. We excused Nixon. I guess Trump, who is also old enough to remember it (he's ten years older than me) wasn't too concerned about paying a price if his attempted coup didn't work. Now they're getting ready to do it again, they're doing it in the open, and it looks like a perfect plan. If it works, we've already had the last real national election in the US. From now-on they will all be Putinesqe parodies of fair elections.",

As I go deeper into this project, I'm becoming more resolved that I'm only going to support a subset of feeds. What will come out of it will not be a feed reader in the sense that people think of them for the last 20 or so years. They all try to read everything, and that makes it hard to go beyond the intersection of features found in all feeds. I don't see any point in producing yet another one of those. If people producing blogging software want to give this another shot, they should be ready to retool, a bit. Not very much. Maybe not at all (if you've been considerate in your feeds). And not breaking anything. This is absolute. I will not break anyone either with feeds I produce (I write a popular blog and make blogging software.)

It's free to play, as far as I know (I have a NYT subscription so if it weren't free it's possible I might not know). The diagram to the right is a standard, produced by the game. It tells you how my last game went without giving away the answer. Even that part of the game is clever. </p>\n<p>Anyway, here's the hack...</p>\n<p>Suppose you know the second and third letters, as above, and have eliminated a fair number of consonants, and are sure the first letter is a consonant…</p>\n<p>Type one of the eligable consonants and the next two letters into a web browser and check out the auto completes. Repeat. That's how I figured out the answer to today's puzzle after I got to the situation in the third line. </p>\n<p>I'm pretty consistently getting the answer in four steps. In the first two steps I'm not trying to solve the puzzle, just gathering data. By the third, I constrain my guess by the information I've gathered so far, assuming I've got one or two hits.  </p>\n<p>In this case I got two green squares on the first one. I thought for sure I'd get the answer in three instead of four, but I hadn't eliminated enough consonants to be able to puzzle it out. I was surprised by how hard it was after step three, mostly because (I think) this was a weird word, letter-wise. </p>",

It tells you how my last game went without giving away the answer. Even that part of the game is clever.",
