            "description": "<p>Fact that most if not all herb vaporizers are designed for vaporizing cannabis made it difficult to get reliable information for tobacco use.</p>\n<h1>Tobacco Types</h1>\n<p>I tried three types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RYO Tobacco (I use <a href=\"http://www.tobaccogeneral.com/good-stuff-gold-pipe-tobacco-47-prd1.htm\">The Good Stuff Gold Original</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tobaccogeneral.com/good-stuff-menthol-gold-pipe-49-prd1.htm\">Menthol Gold</a>)</li>\n<li>Pipe Tobacco (tried only <a href=\"http://www.tobaccogeneral.com/captain-black-royal-pipe-tobacco-678-prd1.htm\">Captain Black</a> so far)</li>\n<li>Cigar Tobacco (tried grounded cigars then moved to <a href=\"https://www.leafonly.com/\">whole leaf</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RYO is closest to tobacco used in cigarettes. I found it best for daily use. Pipe tobacco is very rich taste, too rich for frequent use. I typically use it before sleep, best with a glass of finest.</p>\n<p>I found Cigar tobacco to be the most difficult to use with herb vaporizer because they taste best when properly humidified but many vaporizers are not designed to vaporize wet herbs. And dry cigar tobacco is brittle, shedding tobacco particles when you vape.</p>\n<p>Best parts are cost and variety.</p>\n<h1>Vaporization Methods</h1>\n<p><em>Conduction</em> vaporizers use a heated oven to cook the tobacco. <em>Convection</em> vaporizers use hot air flowing through tobacco to vaporize.</p>\n<p>For RYO tobacco, conduction works best. Pipe tobacco can be used with both conduction and convection.</p>\n<p>As to cigar tobacco, I had good result using <a href=\"https://www.planetofthevapes.com/products/boundless-cf-vaporizer\">Boundless CF</a> which has a rather unique deep conduction/convection hybrid oven. Trick was to place RYO tobacco on top of slightly humid cigar leaves to act as a filter of sort.</p>\n<p>Conduction is best for tobacco.</p>\n<h1>Vaporizers</h1>\n<p>I started with <a href=\"https://www.planetofthevapes.com/products/boundless-cf-vaporizer\">Boundless CF</a>. Relatively cheap with deep hybrid oven. Tasted great with everything but plastic around the oven cracked and tobacco started combusting. Replacement I got is holding together so far.</p>\n<p>While waiting for replacement CF, I got <a href=\"https://www.planetofthevapes.com/products/arizer-extreme-q-vaporizer\">Arizer Extreme Q</a>, a desktop convection vaporizer, as backup of sort. Gawdy looking but very reliable. Pipe tobacco tastes great with it but not RYO tobacco.</p>\n<p>Then I got <a href=\"https://www.planetofthevapes.com/products/boundless-cfc-vaporizer\">Boundless CFC</a>. Cheaper and much smaller. Tasted even better than CF but it was too shallow to use with cigar tobacco using technique I mentioned above and, yup, plastic around the oven cracked and fell out.</p>\n<p>Discouraged with plastic, I tried <a href=\"https://www.planetofthevapes.com/products/magic-flight-launch-box-vaporizer\">Magic Flight Launch Box (MFLB)</a> which has great reviews from cannabis users. For tobacco, I just couldn&#8217;t get it working.</p>\n<p>So I returned both CFC and MFLB for <a href=\"https://www.planetofthevapes.com/products/pax-3-vaporizer\">PAX 3</a>. Pipe tobacco worked OK with it although nothing to write home about. I had difficulty getting vape initially but eventually learned I had to wait a bit between vapes to let the oven cook. Note I didn&#8217;t have to do that with CF nor CFC. Maybe that&#8217;s why their plastic cracked? Anyway, PAX 3 is well built so I hope it holds together. WARNING: Current version of PAX 3 iOS app is not recommended due to battery drain, even in background mode.</p>\n<p>Worst parts are price and reliability. Need more DIY in this area.</p>\n<h1>End Note</h1>\n<p>Taste difference between devices is bewilderingly wide. Making it worse, device reviews for tobacco use is hard to find. So please share your experiences and finds.</p>",

But, ironically, this term is difficult to search for obvious reasons. <a href=\"http://battellemedia.com/\">John Battelle</a> even uses it in his blog&#8217;s name. Maybe someone will come up with a better name.</p>\n<p><em>Search Blog</em> is a blog about other blogs/websites. It&#8217;s primary function is to provide a search context. Simple, seemingly familiar yet distinct in usage. Don&#8217;t remember if Yahoo directories allowed each directory to be used as search context. It&#8217;s an obvious idea in hindsight. Jury is out on whether it&#8217;ll be popular however.</p>\n<p>Atlas needs to be a Search Blog as well.</p>",

How?<br />\n<strong>Using what we already have</strong>: blogs, bloggers, blogging tools, and WP community.</p>\n<p>So WordPress Atlas is just <strong>a loosely-coupled network of blogs using a new class of themes</strong>, themes that displays blog contents in a way that looks map-like. Atlas blog contents are information about other blogs. Yes, Atlas blogs are like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog\">Linklogs</a> but more visual-centric.</p>\n<p>What does it look like?

It’s a place where people collect bookmarks presented as cards, through which people can chat with others, etc. Those cards are place-like when laid out.</p>\n<p>But Pinterest layout is not static so they change which is not at all map like. Value of maps is in stable visual memory. Buildings and streets may come and go over time but not overnight or by mere window resize.</p>\n<p>So <strong>Pinterest-like but layed-out in a virtual page</strong> over which visitors will zoom and pan over like Google Map.</p>\n<p><strong>Who will build Atlas blogs and will they come?</strong> I’ll answer this with another question: who builds and maintains those Awsome-xxxx lists on Github and do people use them?</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"3836\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.docuverse.com/2017/06/05/wordpress-atlas/screenshot_264/\" data-orig-file=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/screenshot_264.png\" data-orig-size=\"437,344\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"screenshot_264\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/screenshot_264.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/screenshot_264.png?w=437\" class=\" size-full wp-image-3836 aligncenter\" src=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/screenshot_264.png?w=700\" alt=\"screenshot_264.png\" srcset=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/screenshot_264.png 437w, https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/screenshot_264.png?w=150 150w, https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/screenshot_264.png?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\"   /></p>\n<p>Visual layout is an essential differentiator. Other-wise textual awesome-list is better. It’s a difference that gets emphasized each time user navigates from a blog to a map it links to: <strong>destination map will knows</strong> where, in its layout, the <strong>referring blog</strong> is and display the <strong>neighborhood</strong> around that blog, maybe with some fancy transition animation.</p>\n<p>Atlas pages contain cards laid out in visually memorable, relatively compact patterns. These cards could not only be about individual blogs but blog pages, people (like designers and developers relevant to the <em>neighborhood</em>) and plugins.</p>\n<p>Notion of neighborhood helps with discovery and creates a sense of community.</p>\n<p>Destinations, what cards are about, can be in multiple maps, and maps of same neighborhoods can exist at different depth and filtering (like tourist maps) as well as languages.</p>\n<p>Atlas layout style is dictated by theme designer with vary capabilities. Some would allow streets to be named, like Fashion street, on which cards for major vendors could be placed and backstreets for boutique shops. Maybe specialty shops will form their own specialized clusters, like Latex Cave. When a neighborhood gets too crowded, they can be broken out to their own map linked from original neighborhood. Expansion is no problem. Real Estate value may or may not be controlled. Depends on map creator’s revenue model.</p>\n<p><strong>Experiments to do</strong>: Build a prototype Atlas theme then use it to create an aggregation blog using the theme. Use existing standards like Image Map. Search should include all the blogs on a page as user would expect. This adds value beyond mere link directory role. Get feedback.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>There is a lot to like or dislike about <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/\">Redux</a></strong> but let&#8217;s say the decision to use it has been made and now you need to understand Redux for professional reasons. This post is a good place to start because you first question is most likely how does my component get its data and react to changes in the data?</p>\n<p><strong>Redux connects</strong> to React by wrapping it &#8211; hype-word is <em>higher-order component</em> but, in the end, what you get after calling <code><a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux\">react-redux</a></code> function <code><a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md\">connect</a></code> is a React component placed inside another to enhance or encapsulate.</p>\n<p><strong>Redux data is provided</strong> as properties by the wrapper component. So called <code>mapStateToProps</code>, first function you pass to <code>connect</code>, decides which part of Redux store should be passed as properties to the wrapped component.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes to are detected</strong> by the wrapper component which listens to Redux store. When changes occurs, wrapper component re-renders the wrapped component. Concerns over irrelevant changes and redundant renders should be ignored in the beginning as React itself can soak up a lot of inefficiencies and Redux provides plumbings you can use to reduce unnecessary updates. There are limits, however, and it&#8217;s not that hard to run into them as your application grows.</p>\n<p>At this point, two obvious and related questions arise which are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the wrapper component discover Redux store?</li>\n<li>How does the wrapped component dispatch actions?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Redux store is provided via context</strong> &#8211; use<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux\">react-redux</a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#provider-store\">Provider</a> component to set that up. Wrapped component, however, don&#8217;t usually need direct access to Redux store as data is passed as properties and actions are dispatched via functions which are also passed as properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Use <code>mapDispatchToProps</code>,</strong> second function you pass to <code>connect</code>, to add functions that create and dispatch actions without having to declare <code>contextTypes</code>. It&#8217;s a minor yet useful feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Keeping Redux out of React</strong> is harder than it looks. To dispatch actions, component has to know about dispatching methods it received as props. If actions change, dispatching methods and reducers need to change. Changes to component, Redux state, actions or reducers will often require changes to others. It&#8217;s possible but the cost of creating reusable Redux connected React component is much higher than advertised in my opinion.</p>",

The vision is essentially a projection of what I had in mind with Teleport Network venture but did not get a chance to realize (old chicken and egg problem). As to why I&#8217;m doing this, it&#8217;s because WordPress has the scale and unrealized ideas are like orphans.</p>\n<p><em>the vision starts with:</em></p>\n<p><strong>WordPress Studio</strong> &#8211; is the client-side application I outlined in <a href=\"https://blog.docuverse.com/2017/03/31/future-of-wordpress-desktop/\">the previous post on the subject</a>. It&#8217;s not unlike VSCode in that much of its functionalities are derived from plugins. Plugins should be stackable so the platform itself can be extended to support key features like theming and financial transactions. Theme support, for example, needs HTML and PHP generators which in turn may need digital signature support to secure assets pushed to server. End goals are to <strong>a)</strong> reduce dependence on server-side changes to add features (a la <em>serverless</em> mindset), and <strong>b)</strong> create a vehicle to drive richer user experiences.</p>\n<p><em>followed by:</em></p>\n<p><strong>WordPress Market</strong> &#8211; is a collection of studio plugins working in conjunction with backend services and UX-level plugins to provide rich mix of communication tools and integrated financial services. Intention is to bridge the difference between a collection of webpages and a retail store in RL. It must offer much more than in-page chatbox, even beyond what Slack offers today.</p>\n<p><em>then ends with:</em></p>\n<p><strong>WordPress Atlas</strong> &#8211; uses data-science to pull blogs and websites into neighborhoods, towns, and cities based on topics, interests, and relations. Intention is to use real world metaphors to make discovery and sense of community more natural and explicit than, say, blogroll or news aggregators.</p>\n<p>To me, Facebook is a mega-city of people just talking and exchanging photos, funnies, and insults all day everyday. I don&#8217;t care if Facebook is federated but I do care how drab everything is because you have to use what they offer and no more. I think WordPress can offer a way out of current conundrum without restarting from scratch.</p>",

            "description": "<p>While <a href=\"https://blog.docuverse.com/2017/03/26/old-blog-posts-restored/\">restoring my old blog post</a>, I started thinking about WordPress as a platform. WYSIWYG web site creation services like <a href=\"https://www.wix.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.weebly.com\" target=\"_blank\">Weebly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\">Squarespace</a> and others are gaining attention and growing fast but they are more services than platforms. WordPress on the other hand has an immense collection of plugins and healthy community of developers and designers behind it.</p>\n<p>Main problem I see with WordPress as a platform is that its plugins run on the server-side, creating a compelling long-term incentive to host your own WordPress server to take advantage of features offered by those plugins instead of using WordPress.com. Allowing user-chosen plugins to be installed on WordPress.com creates a gaping security risk and management headaches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/127519682@N02/16189100439\" target=\"_blank\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3065\" data-permalink=\"https://blog.docuverse.com/2017/03/31/future-of-wordpress-desktop/16189100439_84d30fe08f_m/\" data-orig-file=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16189100439_84d30fe08f_m.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"180,240\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"16189100439_84d30fe08f_m\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16189100439_84d30fe08f_m.jpg?w=180\" data-large-file=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16189100439_84d30fe08f_m.jpg?w=180\" class=\" size-full wp-image-3065 aligncenter\" src=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16189100439_84d30fe08f_m.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"16189100439_84d30fe08f_m.jpg\" srcset=\"https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16189100439_84d30fe08f_m.jpg 180w, https://donpark.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/16189100439_84d30fe08f_m.jpg?w=113 113w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\"   /></a></p>\n<p>I think the answer lay with <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/desktop/\">WordPress.com desktop app</a> which currently doesn&#8217;t do much beyond what browser version offers and seemingly neglected. <strong>Key idea</strong> is to add client-side plugins support to the app, plugins that leverage WP REST-API to add features to WordPress-based websites.</p>\n<p>There could be several types of client-side WordPress plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interfaces &#8211; WYSIWYG editors, media libraries, assistants, etc</li>\n<li>Generators &#8211; generates and updates static assets to be added to the website or injected into webpages.</li>\n<li>Augmenters &#8211; marks, corrects, suggests, and injects.</li>\n<li>Monitors &#8211; tracks changes and stats.</li>\n<li>Mediators &#8211; monitors, controls, and routes posts, comments, transactions, etc.</li>\n<li>Services &#8211; client-side workers</li>\n<li>Bridges &#8211; integrates with third-party services and platforms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And adding Docker support will allow servers to run in client-side sandboxes for use by the desktop.</p>\n<p>Result would be a <em>host-neutral</em> platform, one that can address needs of both WordPress.com sites as well as self-hosted sites although it will significantly reduce the need to host your own.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>This post explains what JWT is, without getting into technical details you don&#8217;t need to know. Intention of the post is to dispel some harmful misconceptions.</em></p>\n<p>In short, <strong>JWT is just a piece of data signed by someone</strong>. It doesn&#8217;t do much as-is but it&#8217;s a key building block useful in many applications.</p>\n<h2>What JWT Looks Like</h2>\n<blockquote><p><code>eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ</code></p></blockquote>\n<p>If you look carefully, it&#8217;s basically three gibberish text separated by a period. Th role each part plays are:</p>\n<blockquote><p><code>Header.Payload.Signature</code></p></blockquote>\n<p>They look gibberish because they are encoded. Important part is the <strong>payload</strong>. Rest is there to describe (<em>header</em>) and protect (<em>signature</em>) the payload.</p>\n<h2>What Each Part Does</h2>\n<p><code>Header</code> primarily describes (using JSON) how the <code>Payload</code> was signed so the <code>Signature</code> can be verified.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>{\n \"alg\": \"HS256\",\n \"typ\": \"JWT\"\n}</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>Payload</code> is a collection of name-value pairs presented as JSON like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>{\n  \"sub\": \"1234567890\",\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"admin\": true\n}</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>Signature</code> protects both the <code>Header</code> and the <code>Payload</code> so that neither can be changed without detection.</p>\n<h2>Key Points About JWT</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>JWT doesn&#8217;t say anything meaningful about its <strong>sender, recipient </strong>nor<strong> signer</strong> as-is.</li>\n<li>JWT is <strong>not encrypted</strong> as-is.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not to say JWT can&#8217;t but they have to be added. Allow me to go into a bit more detail on each points.</p>\n<blockquote><p>JWT doesn&#8217;t say anything meaningful about its <strong>sender, recipient </strong>nor<strong> signer</strong> as-is.</p></blockquote>\n<p>JWT typically includes some info on its signer so the signature can be verified but that only proves it was signed by someone who can prove they signed it. Unless the signer is known that is. How one know calls for relationship and/or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Same goes for sender and recipient. To verify sender or recipient, more has to be built-on top of JWT.</p>\n<blockquote><p>JWT is <strong>not encrypted</strong> as-is.</p></blockquote>\n<p>JWT is typically sent unencrypted over a secure channel of communication to a recipient but it may even be printed plainly using QR-code in newspapers. If you need to protect the token, encrypt it whole in  way that only the recipient can decrypt it. If only part of the payload needs to be protected, then encrypt just the value.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Follow up series of posts will discuss how to build with JWT to solve some common problems like protecting APIs or delegated authorization in a mobile app without issues OAuth has. Stay tuned.</em></p>",
